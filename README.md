# 「Grayhours」 for Android
Implementation of 10k-hours theory.
## basic rules and ideas
-The number of  goals or plans you want to set up are limited to only four. More is helpless!
-Once a goal is written down, you can not rename it or remove it unless you delete the whole app and then reinstall.
-You are allowed to record more details than the time consumed for a goal.
-Checking the github-view like graph everyday will force you to fill every blank day.
